The purpose of this repo is to house utilities for connecting eternal warcry
and shifstoned.

Currently, this repo only contains a single utility, getShiftstonedUrl. 
This can be used on an EWC deck detail page (e.g. 
https://eternalwarcry.com/decks/details/tvInDyBOJPw/kiss-me-telut-2-0).

The script adds a function `getShiftstonedUrl()` to the global namespace, 
which returns the shiftstoned url as a string.

Contributions are welcome!
